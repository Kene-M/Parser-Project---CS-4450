# CS 4450 Parser Project
## Project Details
### Overview
This project involves implementing a Python parser using ANTLR 4.13.2 and Python 3.x. The parser is designed to generate a parse tree for specific Python language features, as described in the project requirements. The primary goal is to showcase the parsing of Python syntax constructs while adhering to indentation sensitivity.

## Installation and Setup
### Requirements
* Python 3.x
* ANTLR version 4.13.2

### How to Install (Python Based Installation)
* Make sure you have Python3 installed.
* **Open a terminal or command prompt, and run the following command to install antlr-tools**: *pip install antlr4-tools* (includes ANTLR and automatically installs Java if needed) .
* **Add the directory where the Python scripts are installed to your system's PATH**:
  * **Find out where Python is installed on your system, you can run**: *python -m site --user-base* (Example: C:\Users\madua\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages)
  * Locate the Scripts Directory. Example: C:\Users\madua\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python311 (The Scripts folder should be located inside this directory. The antlr4 should be in the Scripts subfolder)
  * **Add the Python Scripts folder to your system's PATH by modifying the PATH variable for your user account**: *setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Users\madua\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python311\Scripts"*
* Close the current Command Prompt and open a new one to apply the changes.
* **Run the command**: *antlr4* (This will prompt you to install Java 11 if itâ€™s not already installed. If prompted, allow the automatic installation of Java. Once this is set, you can use the antlr4 and antlr4-parse commands directly from your terminal.)
* **To use the generated Python code from your .g4 files, you will need to install the ANTLR4 Python runtime**:  *pip install antlr4-python3-runtime*

### How to Run
* Download or clone the repository to your system.
* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* **Navigate to the project folder**: *cd path-to-project/deliverable 3*
* **Generate parser files (or skip if you want to use what is provided)**: *antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 MiniPyCode.g4*
* **Run the driver code, which parses a python text and prints a tree**: *python Driver.py*
* Compare the output with the parse tree text document provided.
